;--FAQ
CONTENT_FAQ_TITLE=FAQ
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_REMAIN_FREE=Will the Windspots site remain free?
CONTENT_FAQ_REMAIN_FREE_1=Yes, this is one of the reasons that motivated the creation of the association.</br>However, to function, the association needs members and their contributions.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_ASSOCIATION=How to join the association?
CONTENT_FAQ_ASSOCIATION_1=It's simple, either by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@windspots.org">info@windspots.org</a>, or by registering via the <a href="https: //forum.windspots.org" target="_blank">forum</a>.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_HOW_CUSTOM_WEBSITE=Can I customize the site?
CONTENT_FAQ_HOW_CUSTOM_WEBSITE_1=Yes, you can, from the top right menu:
CONTENT_FAQ_HOW_CUSTOM_WEBSITE_2=- Choose the language directly.
CONTENT_FAQ_HOW_CUSTOM_WEBSITE_3=- Choose through the settings icon: the wind unit, the default station, the graphical direction (present on the right or on the left).
CONTENT_FAQ_HOW_CUSTOM_WEBSITE_4=Warning your preferences are stored in a cookie.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_WIND_HISTORY=Is there a wind data history?
CONTENT_FAQ_WIND_HISTORY_1=Yes, through the "12h or 24h" tabs which provides you with 12 or 24 hours of spot weather data from a given date and time.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_HOW_READ_CHART=How do I read the wind chart?
CONTENT_FAQ_HOW_READ_CHART_1=The horizontal values ​​at the bottom of the chart indicate the elapsed minutes, the vertical values ​​at the left of the chart indicate the wind speed. Thus, the graph is read from left (most recent value) to right (oldest value).
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_ARROW_DIRECTION=What does the direction of the arrows indicate?
CONTENT_FAQ_ARROW_DIRECTION_1=The arrows indicate the wind flow (the direction the wind is going).
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_ARROW_DIRECTION_MAP_CHART=Why is the arrow in the wind chart sometimes oriented differently than on the map?
CONTENT_FAQ_ARROW_DIRECTION_MAP_CHART_1=Chart data is updated by station while map is updated by server. There may therefore be a measure of difference between the two pieces of information.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_MISSING_ARROW_CHART=Why are arrows missing in the chart?
CONTENT_FAQ_MISSING_ARROW_CHART_1=Sometimes stations do not transmit information. As we are not extrapolating values, so there are no arrows at this time.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_RELIABILITY_DATA=How reliable is the data provided?
CONTENT_FAQ_RELIABILITY_DATA_1=Wind is usually measured between 3 to 5 meters above the ground. Some weather vanes no longer give us data when the wind exceeds a certain speed (about 70 km/h).
CONTENT_FAQ_RELIABILITY_DATA_2=The water temperature is taken at 1 meter depth at the exit of the lake.
CONTENT_FAQ_RELIABILITY_DATA_3=The air temperature is taken in the shade, but it is often influenced by external elements (walls that "heat", chimney, ...)
CONTENT_FAQ_RELIABILITY_DATA_4=We do not yet have a calibration system for the measurements of our devices, the data is not 100% reliable.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_DATA_NOT_UPDATED=Why is the data not always up to date?
CONTENT_FAQ_DATA_NOT_UPDATED_1=Sometimes stations no longer send data for various reasons, such as GSM, Wifi, power outages, lack of sun for solar powered ones or for technical reasons related to the electronic components of the measurement box. The weather stations are sometimes subject to difficult weather conditions and require regular technical maintenance that we do not always have the financial means to put in place.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_NOT_TEMPERATUE_ALL_SPOTS=Why is there no temperature on some spots?
CONTENT_FAQ_NOT_TEMPERATUE_ALL_SPOTS_1=Because on some spots the Windspots weather station is too far from the lake to properly receive the measurements emitted by the temperature sensor.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_ADD_NEW_SPOTS=How to get new spots?
CONTENT_FAQ_ADD_NEW_SPOTS_1=The association publishes the manual to make a station: <a href="https://github.com/dducret/WindSpots-Hardware" target="_blank">WindSpots Hardware</a>
CONTENT_FAQ_ADD_NEW_SPOTS_2=You can also buy a station from WindSpots Sàrl info@windspots.com.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_INTEGRATE_DATA_IN_MY_WEBSITE=Can I embed WindSpots data into my website?
CONTENT_FAQ_ACQUIRE_INTEGRATE_DATA_IN_MY_WEBSITE_1=Yes
CONTENT_FAQ_ACQUIRE_INTEGRATE_DATA_IN_MY_WEBSITE_2=Either by using an iframe, for example for Les Crêts:</br> https://windspots.org/iframe.php?station=CHGE04&unit=kmh&language=fr_FR&graph=ltr&forecast=ltr&map=false</br>or by using the <a href="https://github.com/dducret/WindSpots-API" target="_blank">api</a>: api.windspots.org.
CONTENT_FAQ_SUB_TITLE_WINDSPOTS_ON_MOBILE=How do I view WindSpots.com on my mobile phone?
